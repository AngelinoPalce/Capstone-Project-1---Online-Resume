        <h1>Angelino Palce</h1>

        <p>I am an aspiring Developer learning to code again and expand my skills in which Web Development is one of them. I was an IT Software Engineer working with Brave Software before I got laid off. I am also working in a startup company called Cliqbux POS in which we are trying to develop a better Point of Sales System. I really Love Coffee.</p>
